# Recruitment

### Graduate students
 
We are recruiting graduate students with interests in aquatic biodiversity, phylogenetics, and habitat adaptations (e.g. temperature, salinity, pollution). Students will be part of a dynamic team of international researchers in aquatic biodiversity, and will have access to new crustacean genomes and transcriptomes and yield their own cutting-edge discoveries! 

Systematic training will include:
* critical thinking
* scientific communication (poster, oral presentation, and writing)
* understanding evolution (particularly the tree of life and biogeography)
* bioinformatics
* molecular lab skills
* fieldwork

More postgrad admission information can be found [here](http://eco.sysu.edu.cn/). Please [contact me](mailto:majx26@mail.sysu.edu.cn) for more detail if you are interested in joining us.
