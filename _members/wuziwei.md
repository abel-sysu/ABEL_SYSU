    My name is Wu Ziwei. I’m now a graduate student    
    I’m slow-witted and like to watch suspensive,    
    brain-burning, thrilling movies or play and love psychology books    
    I enjoy solving some repetitive and tedious work by programming    
    At present, I use bioinformatics to solve questions in
    evolutionary genomics and phylogenetics
